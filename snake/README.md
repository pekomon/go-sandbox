# snake

GUI snake game (to be implemented with Ebiten in a later PR).  
This PR only initializes the module and CI wiring; no game logic yet.

**Planned features (future PRs):**
- Arrow keys to control the snake
- Apples for growth, score, game-over on self/wall collision
- Cross-platform windowed build via Ebiten (Go-native)
