# guessr

Number guessing CLI.

**Planned features (future PRs):**
- Flags: `--max=100`, `--attempts=7`, `--seed=<int>` for deterministic runs
- Hints: "higher"/"lower"
- JSON stats: games played, won, average guesses
- Tests: table-driven, simulate stdin, deterministic seeding
- Standard library only (initially)
